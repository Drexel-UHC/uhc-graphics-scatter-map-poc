{"title":"Why Budapest, Warsaw and Lithuania split themselves in two","description":"Every year, the European Union funnels 50 billion euros (a third of its total budget) to poorer EU regions. As a consequence, poorer regions that get richer would receive less money. As a type of statistical gerrymandering, governors of these regions have redrawn their borders so that the money keeps flowing.","hungary-blank2":"Take for example Hungary. For EU funding, Hungary was divided into 7 regions, each with its own demographic, social and economical characteristics.","hungary-blank3":"On January 1st 2018, Hungary split the region of Central Hungary, or Közép-Magyarország in Hungarian, into two new regions: the Budapest region (containing the capital of the same name) and the surrounding region of Pest.","hungary-blank4":"To understand why the Hungarians did this, we need to look at how distribution of wealth works in the European Union.","p1":"People familiar with the geography and economics of Europe know that the  richer, more developed countries are situated in Western and Northern Europe. On the map, richer countries are <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-110\"  data-th-high=\"110\" data-th-low=\"100\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">shaded</span> <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-125\"  data-th-high=\"125\" data-th-low=\"110\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">in</span> <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-600\"  data-th-high=\"1000\" data-th-low=\"125\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">green</span>, less developed countries are in <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-100\"  data-th-high=\"100\" data-th-low=\"90\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">shades</span> <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-90\"  data-th-high=\"90\" data-th-low=\"75\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">of</span> <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-75\" data-th-high=\"75\" data-th-low=\"0\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">pink</span>, denoting each country’s GDP.","p2":"One of the policies of the EU has been to create more “cohesion,”, jargon for economically catching up poorer, less developed regions with the developed ones. An easy solution would have been to funnel EU money from developed countries to less developed ones, but  rich countries also have poor regions. Poor countries also have rich regions. Let’s see how development changes when we examine the 276 regions of the EU instead of 28 countries.","p4":"Notice the sub-country divisions: <span class=\"highlight country\" id=\"IT\">Italy</span> (developed north, less developed south), <span class=\"highlight country\" id=\"BE\">Belgium</span> (the same) and <span class=\"highlight country\" id=\"DE\">Germany</span> (developed west, less developed east). There are also islands of development in regions containing country capitals (denoted by a black circle = • ): (<span class=\"highlight country\" id=\"ES\">Spain</span>, <span class=\"highlight country\" id=\"FR\">France</span>, <span class=\"highlight country\" id=\"UK\">UK</span>, <span class=\"highlight country\" id=\"PL\">Poland</span>, <span class=\"highlight country\" id=\"RO\">Romania</span>, <span class=\"highlight country\" id=\"SK\">and Slovakia</span>.","p5":"This breakdown into 281 regions is what the EU uses to distribute its “catch-up funds,” money used for construction of transport infrastructure, schools, and hospitals, as well as research and development projects. The <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-75\" data-th-high=\"75\" data-th-low=\"0\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">least developed regions</span> get a bigger share of the 50 billion euros distributed annually and have to cofund less of total project costs. More developed regions receive less money and pay more project costs. <b>Yet  how does the EU decide whether a region is poor or rich? Where are the lines drawn?</b>","p6":"Here is what every region received in catch up funds in the ten years from 2007 until 2016 (numbers for 2016 are only partial). <span class=\"highlight region\" id=\"ES61\">Andalucia</span> is the region that received the most money: it 'absorbed' more than 15 billion € spread over 10 years.","p7":"Of course, population should be taken into account. This map shows total funding per capita per year for the period 2007-2016 (numbers for 2016 are only partial, numbers are in €/capita/year). HIGHLIGHT REGIONS?","p8":"To illustrate the importance of the catch-up funds for some regions, the maps now shows the total funds received in 2015 (the most recent year with complete data available) as a percentage of regional GDP. For some regions, <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-5perc\" data-th-high=\"100\" data-th-low=\"5\", data-measure=\"fundpercgdp15\">the funds amount to more than 5 percent of their gdp</span>. So for many regions the catch-up funds are a very important part of the economy and crucial for public investments.</p>","p9":"Let's return to the map indicating the economic development of every region.","p10":"<p>To better understand this, we turn the map into a chart. On the chart,  every</p><div class=\"legend-list-container\"> <ul id=\"legend-ul\"><li class=\"region-li custom-li\"> represents a region</li><li class=\"country-li custom-li\"> represents a country average</li><li class=\"capital-li custom-li\"> a region containing the country capital</li></ul></div><p>The regions <b>are ordered from left to right by their GDP.</b></p>","p11":"A score of 100 represents the EU average GDP across all regions. A region with a score of 90 has a GDP that’s 90% the EU average.","p12":"The region of Inner London-West is a big outlier: its GDP is more than 600% the EU average and consequently receives little EU catch-up funds. Let’s zoom in so we can see more details for the other regions.","p13":"The range of regional economic development is quite high for many countries, and <span class=\"highlight capital-regions\">regions containing the country’s capital ⦿</span> are much more developed than others.","p14":"<b>The 5 colors used on this chart (as well as the preceding maps) all correspond to EU funding thresholds.</b> Regions with a GDP lower than <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-75\" data-th-high=\"75\" data-th-low=\"0\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">75% of the EU average</span> are considered \"less developed\" and receive the most money from the catch-up funds. The EU pays 85% of all development project costs. Regions with a <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-90\"  data-th-high=\"90\" data-th-low=\"75\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">GDP between 75% and 90%</span> have 60% of project costs paid for by the EU. Other regions (<span class=\"textlegend textlegend-100\"  data-th-high=\"100\" data-th-low=\"90\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">between 90% and 100%</span>, <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-110\"  data-th-high=\"110\" data-th-low=\"100\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">between 100% and 110%</span>, <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-125\"  data-th-high=\"125\" data-th-low=\"110\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">between 110 and 125%</span> or <span class=\"textlegend textlegend-600\"  data-th-high=\"1000\" data-th-low=\"125\" data-measure=\"gdppps17\">above 125% of the average</span>) pay half of the project costs themselves. In short, the EU substantially bankrolls projects for regions, as long as its GDP is 75% the EU average.","p15":"Suppose you are the governor of a lesser-developed region, and the EU has been funding 85% of your project costs. Also suppose your region is developing economically, increasing its GDP, and now it’s on the brink receiving less EU funds. The math of how EU funds are distributed is not working in your favor..","beforeafterintro":"What if you could split your region into two: one that’s rich and one that’s poor, with the latter now  eligible for EU catch-up funds)?  The wealthy part of your region was lifting up the GDP to such an extent that the that the region, as a whole, was excluded from the full benefits of EU catch-up funds.","hungary1":"Let's return to Hungary. The capital Budapest was lifting the surrounding poor area of Pest out of the \"less developed region\" category (< 75% EU Average GDP). As a result, the entire region was not eligible for 85% project funding by the EU.","hungary2":"Hungary asked the EU if it could split the region of Central Hungary into two separate regions: the developed capital Budapest and the less developed surrounding region of Pest.","lithuania1":"A similar situation occurred in Lithuania, which consisted of a single region and its GDP in 2016 was exactly 75% of the EU average. If its economy were to grow, it would lose its status as less developed region and lose catch-up funds.","lithuania2":"Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius is economically the most developed part of the country and is lifting the country’s GDP over the 75% threshold, jeopardizing the catch-up funds of the poorer areas of the country. That is why the Lithuanian government split the country into two EU regions, separating the richer capital from the poorer rest of the country, maintaining its full access to catch-up funds.","poland":"The Poles have done the same with their capital Warsaw, which is now also contained in a separate region.","splitregions":"Modified or new regions should be existing administrative units, or an aggregation of smaller existing administrative units"}
