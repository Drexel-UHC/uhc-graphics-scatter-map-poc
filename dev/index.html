		        <div class='step'>
		            <p>People familiar with the geography and economics of Europe know that the  richer, more developed countries are situated in Western and Northern Europe. On the map, richer countries are <span class="textlegend textlegend-110"  data-th-high="110" data-th-low="100" data-measure="gdppps17">shaded</span> <span class="textlegend textlegend-125"  data-th-high="125" data-th-low="110" data-measure="gdppps17">in</span> <span class="textlegend textlegend-600"  data-th-high="1000" data-th-low="125" data-measure="gdppps17">green</span>, less developed countries are in <span class="textlegend textlegend-100"  data-th-high="100" data-th-low="90" data-measure="gdppps17">shades</span> <span class="textlegend textlegend-90"  data-th-high="90" data-th-low="75" data-measure="gdppps17">of</span> <span class="textlegend textlegend-75" data-th-high="75" data-th-low="0" data-measure="gdppps17">pink</span>, denoting each country’s GDP.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		           <p>One of EU’s policies is to create more “cohesion,” jargon for economically catching up poorer, less developed regions with the developed ones. An easy solution would have been to funnel EU money from developed countries to less developed ones, but  rich countries also have poor regions. Poor countries also have rich regions. Let’s see how development changes when we examine the 281 regions of the EU instead of 28 countries.</p>
		        </div>
		        <!--div class='step'>
		          <p></p>
		        </div-->
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>Notice the sub-country divisions: <span class="highlight country" id="IT">Italy</span> (developed north, less developed south), <span class="highlight country" id="BE">Belgium</span> (the same) and <span class="highlight country" id="DE">Germany</span> (developed west, less developed east). There are also islands of development in regions containing country capitals (denoted by a black circle = • ): (<span class="highlight country" id="ES">Spain</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="FR">France</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="UK">UK</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="PL">Poland</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="RO">Romania</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="SK">and Slovakia</span>.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>This breakdown into regions is what the EU uses to distribute its “catch-up funds,” money used for construction of transport infrastructure, schools, and hospitals and the development of small firms, a low carbon and environment and human capital. The <span class="textlegend textlegend-75 button" data-th-high="75" data-th-low="0" data-measure="gdppps17">least developed regions</span> get a bigger share of the 50 billion euros distributed annually and have to cofund less of total project costs. More developed regions receive less money and pay more project costs. <b>Yet  how does the EU decide whether a region is poor or rich? Where are the lines drawn?</b></p>
		        </div>
		        <!--div class='step'>
		          <p>Here is what every region received in catch up funds in the ten years from 2007 until 2016 (numbers for 2016 are only partial). <span class="highlight region" id="ES61">Andalucia</span> is the region that received the most money: it 'absorbed' more than 15 billion € spread over 10 years.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>Of course, population should be taken into account. This map shows total funding per capita per year for the period 2007-2016 (numbers for 2016 are only partial, numbers are in €/capita/year). HIGHLIGHT REGIONS?</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>To illustrate the importance of the catch-up funds for some regions, the maps now shows the total funds received in 2015 (the most recent year with complete data available) as a percentage of regional GDP. For some regions, <span class="textlegend textlegend-5perc" data-th-high="100" data-th-low="5", data-measure="fundpercgdp15">the funds amount to more than 5 percent of their gdp</span>. So for many regions the catch-up funds are a very important part of the economy and crucial for public investments.</p></p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>Let&#x27;s return to the map indicating the economic development of every region.</p>
		        </div-->
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>To better understand this, we turn the map into a chart. On the chart,  every</p><div class="legend-list-container"> <ul id="legend-ul"><li class="region-li custom-li"> represents a region</li><li class="country-li custom-li"> represents a country average</li><li class="capital-li custom-li"> a region containing the country capital</li></ul></div><p>The regions <b>are ordered from left to right by their GDP.</b></p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>A score of 100 represents the EU average GDP across all regions. A region with a score of 90 has a GDP that’s 90% the EU average.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>The region of Inner London-West is a big outlier: its GDP is more than 600% the EU average and consequently receives little EU catch-up funds. Let’s zoom in so we can see more details for the other regions.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>The range of regional economic development is quite high for many countries, and <span class="highlight capital-regions">regions containing the country’s capital ⦿</span> are much more developed than others.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>

		          <p>Suppose you are the governor of a lesser-developed region, and the EU has been funding 85% of your project costs. Also suppose your region is developing economically, increasing its GDP, and now it’s on the brink receiving less EU funds. The math of how EU funds are distributed is not working in your favor.</p>

		    <p>What if you could split your region into two: one that’s rich and one that’s poor, with the latter now  eligible for EU catch-up funds)?  The wealthy part of your region was lifting up the GDP to such an extent that the that the region, as a whole, was excluded from the full benefits of EU catch-up funds.</p>

		    <p>Let&#x27;s return to Hungary. The capital Budapest was lifting the surrounding poor area of Pest out of the &quot;less developed region&quot; category (&lt; 75% EU Average GDP). As a result, the entire region was not eligible for 85% project funding by the EU.</p>
		    <p>Hungary proposed to the EU that it split the region of Central Hungary into two separate regions: the developed capital Budapest and the less developed surrounding region of Pest.</p>

		    <p>A similar situation occurred in Lithuania, which consisted of a single region and its GDP in 2016 was exactly 75% of the EU average. If its economy were to grow, it would lose its status as less developed region and lose full access to the catch-up funds.</p>
		    <p>Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius is economically the most developed part of the country and is lifting the country’s GDP over the 75% threshold, jeopardizing the catch-up funds of the poorer areas of the country. That is why the Lithuanian government split the country into two EU regions, separating the richer capital from the poorer rest of the country, maintaining its priviliged access to catch-up funds.</p>

		    <h2>What does it mean to split up regions?</h2>
		    <p>Every three years, the EU asks its members states if they want to revise the boundaries of their regions. Member states can propose changes, which the EU then checks against certain criteria:</p>
		    <ol><li>Modified or new regions should be existing administrative units, or an aggregation of smaller existing administrative units</li><li>There shouldn’t be any gaps in the national territory</li><li>Every region should have a population between 800,000 and 3 million people</li></ol>
		    <p>If these criteria are met, the EU can decide to approve the new region’s boundaries. But creating new regions comes at a cost: member states have to report a wide variety of statistics for every region in its borders. Not only do they have to report on the regional GDP, but also demography, employment, education and poverty. And this obligation is retroactive: after a new region is created, historical time series for all statistics in the new region have to be reported to the EU within 2 years. Collection of this data is a large investment.</p>
		    <p>Large cities and their surrounding areas often operate differently socio-economically; collecting statistics and designing policy on both parts separately makes sense. But it also means that the management of EU development projects is delegated to poorer regions’ governments, which do not always have the adequate capacity to manage large investments.</p>
		    <p>Splitting regions into poorer and richer ones can be looked at as creating less cohesion: one dot in the middle of the chart is replaced by new ones on the left and right. But it allows for the catch-up funds to be better targeted on the areas that need it most.</p>

		    <h2>Reforms</h2>
		    <p>The EU catch-up funds are organised in a 7 year cycle, and the current funding period of 2014-2020 is nearing its end. The rules for receiving money from the funds in the following period (2021-2027) are being currently discussed, and they will be decided on after the elections for the European Parliament in May 2019. One proposal is to not exclusively focus on GDP for determining how much money a region can receive and the rate at which it contributes. GDP would remain the dominant factor, but to reflect reality, statistics on education levels and youth unemployment will also be taken into account, as will policies on climate change and migration.</p>
		    <p>Of course, to assure that money actually flows to the poorest areas, a more fine-grained geographical subdivision should be used: just as rich countries have less developed regions, rich regions have less developed areas that could benefit from public investment. But this would lead to scaling problems: collecting statistics on a smaller subdivisions would be costly, and managing the funds and projects could become very complicated. So the EU opted to require regions to have 800,000 to 3 million inhabitants. While this threshold  will always have some arbitrariness to it, regions can amend their boundaries and even split up in order to bring the flow of the catch-up funds more in line with the situation on the ground.</p>
		    <p>Finally, another reform for the next funding cycle is to put more emphasis on communication, which would improve the visibility of funds and make their workings better known to the public.</p>

		    <h2>Methods</h2>
		    <p>The GDP numbers used by the EU to categorize regions are per capita and corrected for purchasing power. This means that a region’s GDP is divided by the number of inhabitants of the region and is then corrected for the cost of living in each region. In this way, regions with low wages but low cost of living can be better compared to regions were wages are high, but where it is more expensive to live. In the last step of the calculation, the EU average is set to 100 and all regional GDP numbers are made relative to the EU average.</p>
		    <p>The numbers used throughout this article are the <a href=”http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=BOOKMARK_DS-513634_QID_10FA3B0_UID_-3F171EB0&layout=UNIT,L,X,0;GEO,L,Y,0;TIME,C,Z,0;INDICATORS,C,Z,1;&zSelection=DS-513634TIME,2017;DS-513634INDICATORS,OBS_FLAG;&rankName1=TIME_1_0_-1_2&rankName2=INDICATORS_1_2_-1_2&rankName3=UNIT_1_2_0_0&rankName4=GEO_1_2_0_1&rStp=&cStp=&rDCh=&cDCh=&rDM=true&cDM=true&footnes=false&empty=false&wai=false&time_mode=NONE&time_most_recent=false&lang=EN&cfo=%23%23%23%2C%23%23%23.%23%23%23”>2017 regional GDP numbers</a> (published in February 2019). For the regions that where split up, and for the maps showing the regions before the splitting of regions, the 2016 GDP numbers were used.</p>
		    <p>EU regions boundaries before (NUTS2013) and after (NUTS2016) splitting <a href=”https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/gisco/geodata/reference-data/administrative-units-statistical-units/nuts#nuts16”>are published on the Eurostat website</a>. For technical reasons, some overseas regions are not shown on the map and chart.</p>
