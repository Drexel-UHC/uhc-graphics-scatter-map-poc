		            <p>People familiar with the geography and economics of Europe know that the  richer, more developed countries are situated in Western and Northern Europe. On the map, richer countries are <span class="textlegend textlegend-110"  data-th-high="110" data-th-low="100" data-measure="gdppps17">shaded</span> <span class="textlegend textlegend-125"  data-th-high="125" data-th-low="110" data-measure="gdppps17">in</span> <span class="textlegend textlegend-600"  data-th-high="1000" data-th-low="125" data-measure="gdppps17">green</span>, less developed countries are in <span class="textlegend textlegend-100"  data-th-high="100" data-th-low="90" data-measure="gdppps17">shades</span> <span class="textlegend textlegend-90"  data-th-high="90" data-th-low="75" data-measure="gdppps17">of</span> <span class="textlegend textlegend-75" data-th-high="75" data-th-low="0" data-measure="gdppps17">pink</span>, denoting each country’s GDP.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		           <p>One of the policies of the EU has been to create more “cohesion,”, jargon for economically catching up poorer, less developed regions with the developed ones. An easy solution would have been to funnel EU money from developed countries to less developed ones, but  rich countries also have poor regions. Poor countries also have rich regions. Let’s see how development changes when we examine the 276 regions of the EU instead of 28 countries.</p>
		        </div>
		        <!--div class='step'>
		          <p></p>
		        </div-->
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>Notice the sub-country divisions: <span class="highlight country" id="IT">Italy</span> (developed north, less developed south), <span class="highlight country" id="BE">Belgium</span> (the same) and <span class="highlight country" id="DE">Germany</span> (developed west, less developed east). There are also islands of development in regions containing country capitals (denoted by a black circle = • ): (<span class="highlight country" id="ES">Spain</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="FR">France</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="UK">UK</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="PL">Poland</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="RO">Romania</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="SK">and Slovakia</span>.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>This breakdown into 281 regions is what the EU uses to distribute its “catch-up funds,” money used for construction of transport infrastructure, schools, and hospitals, as well as research and development projects. The <span class="textlegend textlegend-75" data-th-high="75" data-th-low="0" data-measure="gdppps17">least developed regions</span> get a bigger share of the 50 billion euros distributed annually and have to cofund less of total project costs. More developed regions receive less money and pay more project costs. <b>Yet  how does the EU decide whether a region is poor or rich? Where are the lines drawn?</b></p>
		        </div>
		        <!--div class='step'>
		          <p>Here is what every region received in catch up funds in the ten years from 2007 until 2016 (numbers for 2016 are only partial). <span class="highlight region" id="ES61">Andalucia</span> is the region that received the most money: it 'absorbed' more than 15 billion € spread over 10 years.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>Of course, population should be taken into account. This map shows total funding per capita per year for the period 2007-2016 (numbers for 2016 are only partial, numbers are in €/capita/year). HIGHLIGHT REGIONS?</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>To illustrate the importance of the catch-up funds for some regions, the maps now shows the total funds received in 2015 (the most recent year with complete data available) as a percentage of regional GDP. For some regions, <span class="textlegend textlegend-5perc" data-th-high="100" data-th-low="5", data-measure="fundpercgdp15">the funds amount to more than 5 percent of their gdp</span>. So for many regions the catch-up funds are a very important part of the economy and crucial for public investments.</p></p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>Let&#x27;s return to the map indicating the economic development of every region.</p>
		        </div-->
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>To better understand this, we turn the map into a chart. On the chart,  every</p><div class="legend-list-container"> <ul id="legend-ul"><li class="region-li custom-li"> represents a region</li><li class="country-li custom-li"> represents a country average</li><li class="capital-li custom-li"> a region containing the country capital</li></ul></div><p>The regions <b>are ordered from left to right by their GDP.</b></p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>A score of 100 represents the EU average GDP across all regions. A region with a score of 90 has a GDP that’s 90% the EU average.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>The region of Inner London-West is a big outlier: its GDP is more than 600% the EU average and consequently receives little EU catch-up funds. Let’s zoom in so we can see more details for the other regions.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>The range of regional economic development is quite high for many countries, and <span class="highlight capital-regions">regions containing the country’s capital ⦿</span> are much more developed than others.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p><b>The 5 colors used on this chart (as well as the preceding maps) all correspond to EU funding thresholds.</b> Regions with a GDP lower than <span class="textlegend textlegend-75" data-th-high="75" data-th-low="0" data-measure="gdppps17">75% of the EU average</span> are considered "less developed" and receive the most money from the catch-up funds. The EU pays 85% of all development project costs. Regions with a <span class="textlegend textlegend-90"  data-th-high="90" data-th-low="75" data-measure="gdppps17">GDP between 75% and 90%</span> have 60% of project costs paid for by the EU. Other regions (<span class="textlegend textlegend-100"  data-th-high="100" data-th-low="90" data-measure="gdppps17">between 90% and 100%</span>, <span class="textlegend textlegend-110"  data-th-high="110" data-th-low="100" data-measure="gdppps17">between 100% and 110%</span>, <span class="textlegend textlegend-125"  data-th-high="125" data-th-low="110" data-measure="gdppps17">between 110 and 125%</span> or <span class="textlegend textlegend-600"  data-th-high="1000" data-th-low="125" data-measure="gdppps17">above 125% of the average</span>) pay half of the project costs themselves. In short, the EU substantially bankrolls projects for regions, as long as its GDP is 75% the EU average.</p>

		          <p>Suppose you are the governor of a lesser-developed region, and the EU has been funding 85% of your project costs. Also suppose your region is developing economically, increasing its GDP, and now it’s on the brink receiving less EU funds. The math of how EU funds are distributed is not working in your favor..</p>

		    <p>What if you could split your region into two: one that’s rich and one that’s poor, with the latter now  eligible for EU catch-up funds)?  The wealthy part of your region was lifting up the GDP to such an extent that the that the region, as a whole, was excluded from the full benefits of EU catch-up funds.</p>

		    <p>Let&#x27;s return to Hungary. The capital Budapest was lifting the surrounding poor area of Pest out of the &quot;less developed region&quot; category (&lt; 75% EU Average GDP). As a result, the entire region was not eligible for 85% project funding by the EU.</p>
		    <p>Hungary proposed to the EU that it split the region of Central Hungary into two separate regions: the developed capital Budapest and the less developed surrounding region of Pest.</p>

		    <p>A similar situation occurred in Lithuania, which consisted of a single region and its GDP in 2016 was exactly 75% of the EU average. If its economy were to grow, it would lose its status as less developed region and lose catch-up funds.</p>
		    <p>Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius is economically the most developed part of the country and is lifting the country’s GDP over the 75% threshold, jeopardizing the catch-up funds of the poorer areas of the country. That is why the Lithuanian government split the country into two EU regions, separating the richer capital from the poorer rest of the country, maintaining its full access to catch-up funds.</p>

		    <h2>What does it mean to split up regions?</h2>
		    <p>Every three years, the EU asks its members states if they want to revise the boundaries of their regions. Member states can propose changes, which the EU then checks against certain criteria:</p>
		    <ol><li>Modified or new regions should be existing administrative units, or an aggregation of smaller existing administrative units</li><li>There shouldn’t be any gaps in the national territory</li><li>Every region should have a population between 800,000 and 3 million people</li></ol>
		    <p>If these criteria are met, the EU can decide to approve the new region’s boundaries. But creating new regions comes at a cost: member states have to report a wide variety of statistics for every region in its borders. Not only do they have to report on the regional GDP, but also demography, employment, education and poverty. And this obligation is retroactive: after a new region is created, historical time series for all statistics in the new region have to be reported to the EU within 2 years. Collection of this data is a large investment.</p>
		    <p>Large cities and their surrounding areas often  operate  differently socio-economically—collecting statistics and designing policy on both parts separately makes sense. But it also means that the management of EU development projects is delegated to poorer regions’ governments, which do not always have the adequate capacity to manage large investments.</p>
		    <p>Splitting regions into poorer and richer regions contributes to less cohesion: one dot in the middle of the chart is replaced by a new one on the left and another new one on the right of the chart.</p>

		    <h2>Reforms</h2>
		    <p>The EU catch-up funds are organised in a 7 year cycle, and the current funding period of 2013-2020 is nearing its end. The rules for receiving money from the funds in the following period (2021-2027) are currently discussed, and will probably be decided on before the elections for the European Parliament in May 2019. One proposal on the table is to not only focus anymore on GDP numbers for determining how much money a region can receive and at what rate it has to contribute itself. GDP will remain the dominant factor (that is why the 3 regions split themselves up), but to reflect the reality on the ground a bit more, statistics on education levels and youth unemployment will also be taken into account, as will policies on climate change and migration.</p>
		    <p>Of course, to really reflect the situation on the ground, and assure that money actually flows to the poorest areas, a more finegrained geographical subdivision should be used: just like rich countries have less developed regions, rich regions may also have less developed areas that could benefit from public investment projects. But this would lead to some scaling problems: collecting the necessary statistics on a more finegrained subdivision of the territory would be very costly, and managing the funds and projects could become very complicated. So the EU opted to work with the middle scale regions of 800.000 to 3 million inhabitants. This subdivision will always have some arbitrariness to it, and that is why regions can amend their boundaries, and even split up, to bring the flow of the catch-up funds more in line with the situation on the ground.</p>
		    <p>One of the other reforms of the catch-up funds in the next funding cycle, is to put more emphasis on communication to improve the visibility of the funds and to make the funds and their working better known to the public. The Pudding is at your service, EU ;-)</p>
