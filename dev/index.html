		    <p>Take for example Hungary. For EU funding, Hungary was divided into 7 regions, each with its own demographic, social and economical characteristics.</p>
		    <p>On January 1st 2018, Hungary split the region of Central Hungary, or Közép-Magyarország in Hungarian, into the Budapest region (containing the capital of the same name) and the surrounding region of Pest.</p>

		            <p>People familiar with the geography and economics of Europe know where the rich, developed countries are, situated mostly in Western and Northern Europe. On the map, richer countries are <span class="textlegend textlegend-110"  data-th-high="110" data-th-low="100" data-measure="gdppps16">shaded</span> <span class="textlegend textlegend-125"  data-th-high="125" data-th-low="110" data-measure="gdppps16">in</span> <span class="textlegend textlegend-600"  data-th-high="1000" data-th-low="125" data-measure="gdppps16">green</span>, less developed countries are in <span class="textlegend textlegend-100"  data-th-high="100" data-th-low="90" data-measure="gdppps16">shades</span> <span class="textlegend textlegend-90"  data-th-high="90" data-th-low="75" data-measure="gdppps16">of</span> <span class="textlegend textlegend-75" data-th-high="75" data-th-low="0" data-measure="gdppps16">pink</span>, denoting economic development via each region’s gross domestic product of countries and regions.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		           <p>One of the policies of the EU has been to create more &quot;cohesion&quot;, jargon for poorer and less developed regions catching up economically with the developed ones. An easy solution would have been to funnel EU money from developed countries to less developed ones. But the policy makers knew that rich countries also have poor regions and poor countries also have richer regions. Let’s see how development changes when we examine the 276 regions of the EU instead of 28 countries.</p>
		        </div>
		        <!--div class='step'>
		          <p></p>
		        </div-->
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>Notice the geographical divisions in <span class="highlight country" id="IT">Italy</span> (developed north, less developed south), <span class="highlight country" id="BE">Belgium</span> (the same) and <span class="highlight country" id="DE">Germany</span> (developed west, less developed east), and the islands of development that are the regions containing the capitals (denoted by a black circle = • ) (<span class="highlight country" id="ES">Spain</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="FR">France</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="UK">UK</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="PL">Poland</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="RO">Romania</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="SK">Slovakia</span>)</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>This breakdown into 276 regions is what the EU uses to distribute its “catch-up funds,” money used the construction of transport infrastructure, , schools, and hospitals, as well as research and development projects, for example. The <span class="textlegend textlegend-75" data-th-high="75" data-th-low="0" data-measure="gdppps16">least developed regions</span> get a bigger share of the 50 billion euros distributed annually and have to cofund less of total project costs. More developed regions receive less money and pay more of the project costs. <b>So how does the EU decide whether a region is poor or rich? Where are the lines drawn?</b></p>
		        </div>
		        <!--div class='step'>
		          <p>Here is what every region received in catch up funds in the ten years from 2007 until 2016 (numbers for 2016 are only partial). <span class="highlight region" id="ES61">Andalucia</span> is the region that received the most money: it 'absorbed' more than 15 billion € spread over 10 years.</p>

		          <p>Suppose you are the governor of one of the three regions annotated on the chart (Warsaw, Budapest, and Lithuania),  which are all on the brink of a funding threshold and able to receive  additional EU funds  as a lesser developed region. Suppose one part of your region hosts the country capital and is relatively rich, while the other part of your region is quite poor and its GDP is actually well below the EU funding threshold. The wealthy part of your region is lifting up the GDP to an extent that the that the region as a whole, could be excluded from the full benefits of EU catch-up funds.</p>

		    <p>Let&#x27;s return to Hungary. The capital Budapest was lifting the surrounding poor area of Pest out of the “less developed region” category (&lt; 75% EU Average GDP). As a result, the region was missing out on funding.</p>
		    <p>Hungary asked the EU if it could split the region of Central Hungary into two separate regions: the developed capital Budapest and the less developed surrounding region of Pest.</p>

		    <p>A similar situation occurred in Lithuania, which consisted of a single region and its GDP in 2016 was exactly 75% of the EU average. If its economy were to grow, it would lose its status as less developed region and lose catch-up funds.</p>
		    <p>Lithuania’s capital, Vilnius is economically the most developed part of the country and is lifting the country’s GDP over the 75% threshold, bringing the eligibility for the catch-up funds of the poorer areas of the country in jeopardy. That is why the Lithuanian government split the country into two EU regions, separating the richer capital from the poorer rest of the country, maintaining its full access to catch-up funds.</p>

		    <h2>What does it mean to split up regions?</h2>
		    <p>Every three years, the EU asks its members states if they want to revise the boundaries of their regions. Member states can propose changes, which the EU then checks against these criteria:
		      <ul>
		        <li>modified or new regions should be existing administrative units, or an aggregation of smaller existing administrative units</li>
		        <li>there shouldn’t be any gaps in the national territory</li>
		        <li>every region should have a population between 800.000 and 3 million people</li>
		      </ul>
		    </p>
		    <p>If these criteria are met, the EU can decide to approve the new region boundaries. But creating new regions is not free for member states: member states have to report a wide variety of statistics at the regional level. Not only do they have to report on the regional gdp, they also have to provide numbers on demography, employment, education and poverty. And this obligation is retroactive: after a new region is created, historical time series for all statistics for the new region have to be reported to the EU within 2 years. Collection of this data can mean a big investment for some regions.</p>
		    <p>As capital cities and their hinterlands do work quite differently socio-economically, splitting them up and collecting statistics on both parts separately and designing policy specifically makes some sense. But it also means that the management of EU development projects is delegated to poorer regions governments. And those governments not always have the adequate capacity to manage these.</p>
		    <p>Splitting regions into poorer and richer regions contributes to less cohesion: usually one dot in the middle of the chart is replaced by a new one on the left and another new one on the right of the chart.</p>

		    <h2>Reforms</h2>
		    <p>The EU catch-up funds are organised in a 7 year cycle, and the current funding period of 2013-2020 is nearing its end. The rules for receiving money from the funds in the following period (2021-2027) are currently discussed, and will probably be decided on before the elections for the European Parliament in May 2019. One proposal on the table is to not only focus anymore on gdp numbers for determining how much money a region can receive and at what rate it has to contribute itself. Gdp will remain the dominant factor (that is why 3 regions split themselves up), but to reflect the reality on the ground a bit more, statistics on education levels and youth unemployment will also be taken into account, as will policies on climate change and migration.</p>
		    <p>Of course, to really reflect the situation on the ground, and assure that money actually flows to the poorest areas, a more finegrained geographical subdivision should be used: just like rich countries have less developed regions, rich regions may also have less developed areas that could benefit from public investment projects. But this would lead to some scaling problems: collecting the necessary statistics on a more finegrained subdivision of the territory would be very costly, and managing the funds and projects could become very complicated. So the EU opted to work with the middle scale regions of 800.000 to 3 million inhabitants. This subdivision will always have some arbitrariness to it, and that is why regions can amend their boundaries, and even split up, to bring the flow of the catch-up funds more in line with the situation on the ground.</p>
		    <p>One of the other reforms of the catch-up funds in the next funding cycle, is to put more emphasis on communication to improve the visibility of the funds and to make the funds and their working better known to the public. The Pudding is at your service, EU ;-)</p>
