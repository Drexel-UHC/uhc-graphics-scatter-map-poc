		        <div class='step'>
		            <p>1.People familiar with the geography and economics of Europe know where the rich, developed countries are: they are mostly situated in Western and Northern Europe. On the map, the developed countries are shaded in green, less developed countries are in shades of brown. These colors are used throughout this article. Their exact meaning is not very important yet here, but they will be explained later on.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		           <p>2. For a long time, one of the policies of the EU  has been to create more &quot;cohesion&quot;, eurocrat jargon for poorer and less developed regions catching up with the developed ones. An easy solution for EU policy makers would have been to just funnel EU money from developed countries to less developed ones.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>3. But the policy makers were smarter and knew that rich countries also have poor regions and poor countries also have richer regions. Check the map.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>
		            Notice the geographical divisions in <span class="highlight country" id="IT">Italy</span> (developed north, less developed south), <span class="highlight country" id="BE">Belgium</span> (the same) and <span class="highlight country" id="DE">Germany</span> (developed west, less developed east), and the islands of development that are the regions containing the capitals • (<span class="highlight country" id="ES">Spain</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="FR">France</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="UK">UK</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="PL">Poland</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="RO">Romania</span>, <span class="highlight country" id="SK">Slovakia</span>, ...)
		          </p>        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>5. This breakdown in 276 regions is what the European Union uses to distribute its catch-up funds for the construction of transport infrastructure, the construction of schools and hospitals and research and development projects, for example. Poorer regions get a bigger share of the 50 billion € that is distributed annually, and have to cofund less of total project costs.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>
		            Here is what every region received in catch up funds in the ten years from 2007 until 2016 (numbers for 2016 are only partial). <span class="highlight region" id="ES61">Andalucia</span> is the region that received the most money: it 'absorbed' more than 15 billion € spread over 10 years.
		          </p>        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>7. Of course, population should be taken into account. The following map shows total funding per capita per year for the period 2007-2016 (numbers for 2016 are only partial, numbers are in €/capita/year). HIGHLIGHT REGIONS?</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>8. To illustrate the importance of the catch-up funds for some regions, the following map shows the total funds received in 2015 (the most recent year with complete data available) as a percentage of regional GDP. For some regions, the funds amount to more than 5 percent of the gdp. So for many regions the catch-up funds are a very important part of the economy and crucial for public investments. HIGHLIGHT REGIONS?</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>9. Let&#x27;s return to the map indicating the economic development of every region.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>10. Let&#x27;s skip the geography for now and focus on the numbers. On the  chart, every circle is a region and diamonds represent country averages. Regions containing the country capital are marked with a dot. The regions are ordered according to their economic development, measured as the regional gdp compared to the EU average.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>11. The EU average is set to 100, so a region with an economic development score of 90 has a gdp of 90 % of the EU average.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>12.  Inner London is a big outlier: it’s gdp is more than 600 percent of the EU average. Let’s zoom the axis a bit, so we can see more details for the other regions.</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>13. It is clear that the range of regional economic development is quite big for many countries: national averages hide a very big diversity in regional economic development. In almost all countries, regions containing the country capital (dotted circles) are much more developed than the other regions of the country. HIGHLIGHT OTHER REGIONS?</p>
		        </div>
		        <div class='step'>
		          <p>
		            The colors on the charts and maps in this article represent the classes of economic development. The boundaries of these classes weren't chosen arbitrarily. They are actually very important in determining how much money each region can receive and how much money each region should invest itself, on top of the EU subsidies.</p>
		            <p>Regions with a gross domestic product lower than <span class="textlegend textlegend-75" data-threshold="75">75% of the EU average</span> are considered "less developed" and receive the most money. They only have to cofund 15 % of the total development project costs, so the EU pays 85 % of the costs. Regions with a <span class="textlegend textlegend-90" data-threshold="90">gdp between 75 and 90%</span> have to pay 40 % of the project costs themselves. Other regions (<span class="textlegend textlegend-100" data-threshold="100">between 90 and 100%</span>, <span class="textlegend textlegend-110" data-threshold="125">between 100 and 110%</span>, <span class="textlegend textlegend-125" data-threshold="125">between 110 and 125%</span> or <span class="textlegend textlegend-600" data-threshold="700">above 125% of the average</span>) pay half of the project costs themselves.

		          <p>15. Can you see the three regions highlighted now on the chart? Those are the regions from the title of this article. Now suppose you are the governor of one of these regions, well above above or on the brink of exceeding the thresholds to receive money from the Cohesion funds as a less developed region. And you know your regional gdp is also hiding a big gap in prosperity at a smaller geographical scale: one part of your region hosts the country capital and is relatively rich, while the other part of your region is quite poor and its gdp is actually well below the thresholds. But the wealthy part of your region is lifting the average up so high, that the region as a whole, including the poor part, is excluded from the full benefits of the catch-up funds.</p>

		    <p>So… what if you could split your region into one very rich one and a poor one, that would actually be eligible to receive more money? That is what actually happened in the regions from the title of this article. Let&#x27;s take a closer look at them.</p>
		  </div>
		  <div>
		    <p>The first one is Lithuania. For the EU, the country of Lithuania was a single region and its gdp in 2016 was exactly 75% of the EU average. So if its economy catches up a little more, it will lose its status as less developed region and miss out on a lot of money.</p>

		      <svg id="lithuania16"></svg>
		  </div>
		  <div>
		    <p>The capital Vilnius, in the southeast of the country is economically the most developed region of the country and is lifting the country’s gdp over the 75% threshold, bringing the eligibility for the catch-up funds of the poorer regions of the country in jeopardy. That is why the Lithuanian government asked the EU to split the country into 2 EU regions, separating the rich(er) capital from the poorer rest of the country, which would maintain its full access to the catch-up funds.</p>
		  </div>
		</section>		<section class='filler'>
		  <div>
		    <p>The same has happened in Hungary, where the capital Budapest was lifting the surrounding Pest county into ineligibility for the catch-up funds. Both were part of the Central Hungary region, but they are now separate regions.</p>

		    <h2>What does it mean to split up regions?</h2>
		    <p>Every three years, the EU asks its members states if they want to revise the boundaries of their regions. Member states can propose changes, which the EU then checks against these criteria:
		      <ul>
		        <li>modified or new regions should be existing administrative units, or an aggregation of smaller existing administrative units</li>
		        <li>there shouldn’t be any gaps in the national territory</li>
		        <li>every region should have a population between 800.000 and 3 million people</li>
		      </ul>
		    </p>
		    <p>If these criteria are met, the EU can decide to approve the new region boundaries. But creating new regions is not free for member states: member states have to report a wide variety of statistics at the regional level. Not only do they have to report on the regional gdp, they also have to provide numbers on demography, employment, education and poverty. And this obligation is retroactive: after a new region is created, historical time series for all statistics for the new region have to be reported to the EU within 2 years. Collection of this data can mean a big investment for some regions.</p>
		    <p>As capital cities and their hinterlands do work quite differently socio-economically, splitting them up and collecting statistics on both parts separately and designing policy specifically makes some sense. But it also means that the management of EU development projects is delegated to poorer regions governments. And those governments not always have the adequate capacity to manage these.</p>
		    <p>Splitting regions into poorer and richer regions contributes to less cohesion: usually one dot in the middle of the chart is replaced by a new one on the left and another new one on the right of the chart.</p>

		    <h2>Reforms</h2>
		    <p>The EU catch-up funds are organised in a 7 year cycle, and the current funding period of 2013-2020 is nearing its end. The rules for receiving money from the funds in the following period (2021-2027) are currently discussed, and will probably be decided on before the elections for the European Parliament in May 2019. One proposal on the table is to not only focus anymore on gdp numbers for determining how much money a region can receive and at what rate it has to contribute itself. Gdp will remain the dominant factor (that is why 3 regions split themselves up), but to reflect the reality on the ground a bit more, statistics on education levels and youth unemployment will also be taken into account, as will policies on climate change and migration.</p>
		    <p>Of course, to really reflect the situation on the ground, and assure that money actually flows to the poorest areas, a more finegrained geographical subdivision should be used: just like rich countries have less developed regions, rich regions may also have less developed areas that could benefit from public investment projects. But this would lead to some scaling problems: collecting the necessary statistics on a more finegrained subdivision of the territory would be very costly, and managing the funds and projects could become very complicated. So the EU opted to work with the middle scale regions of 800.000 to 3 million inhabitants. This subdivision will always have some arbitrariness to it, and that is why regions can amend their boundaries, and even split up, to bring the flow of the catch-up funds more in line with the situation on the ground.</p>
		    <p>One of the other reforms of the catch-up funds in the next funding cycle, is to put more emphasis on communication to improve the visibility of the funds and to make the funds and their working better known to the public. The Pudding is at your service, EU ;-)</p>
