    <h2>Reforms</h2>
    <p>The EU catch-up funds are organised in a 7 year cycle, and the current funding period of 2013-2020 is nearing its end. The rules for receiving money from the funds in the following period (2021-2027) are currently discussed, and will probably be decided on before the elections for the European Parliament in May 2019. One proposal on the table is to not only focus anymore on gdp numbers for determining how much money a region can receive and at what rate it has to contribute itself. Gdp will remain the dominant factor (that is why 3 regions split themselves up), but to reflect the reality on the ground a bit more, statistics on education levels and youth unemployment will also be taken into account, as will policies on climate change and migration.</p>
    <p>Of course, to really reflect the situation on the ground, and assure that money actually flows to the poorest areas, a more finegrained geographical subdivision should be used: just like rich countries have less developed regions, rich regions may also have less developed areas that could benefit from public investment projects. But this would lead to some scaling problems: collecting the necessary statistics on a more finegrained subdivision of the territory would be very costly, and managing the funds and projects could become very complicated. So the EU opted to work with the middle scale regions of 800.000 to 3 million inhabitants. This subdivision will always have some arbitrariness to it, and that is why regions can amend their boundaries, and even split up, to bring the flow of the catch-up funds more in line with the situation on the ground.</p>
    <p>One of the other reforms of the catch-up funds in the next funding cycle, is to put more emphasis on communication to improve the visibility of the funds and to make the funds and their working better known to the public. The Pudding is at your service, EU ;-)</p>
