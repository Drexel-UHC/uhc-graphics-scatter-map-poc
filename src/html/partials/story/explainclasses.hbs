  The colors on the charts and maps in this article represent the classes of economic development. The boundaries of these classes weren't chosen arbitrarily. They are actually very important in determining how much money each region can receive and how much money each region should invest itself, on top of the EU subsidies.</p>
  <p>Regions with a gross domestic product lower than <span class="textlegend textlegend-75" data-threshold="75">75% of the EU average</span> are considered "less developed" and receive the most money. They only have to cofund 15 % of the total development project costs, so the EU pays 85 % of the costs. Regions with a <span class="textlegend textlegend-90" data-threshold="90">gdp between 75 and 90%</span> have to pay 40 % of the project costs themselves. Other regions (<span class="textlegend textlegend-110" data-threshold="110">between 90 and 110%</span>, <span class="textlegend textlegend-125" data-threshold="125">between 110 and 125%</span> or <span class="textlegend textlegend-600" data-threshold="700">above 125% of the average</span>) pay half of the project costs themselves.
